# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- One-line installers: `install.sh` for macOS and Linux, `install.ps1` for Windows. Both verify SHA-256 checksums and need no admin rights.
- Prebuilt release binaries for Linux (x64, ARM64), macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon) and Windows (x64).
- Windows support: agents installed as `.exe` or npm `.cmd` shims are found automatically, and the token secret can be copied with `clip`.
- `HASHI_REDUCED_MOTION=1` freezes spinners, shimmer and other animation.

### Changed

- Dashboard body text follows the terminal's foreground colour, so light themes are readable.
- Running requests show live elapsed time in the table, detail pane and agent cards.
- `q` asks for confirmation while requests are in flight. `Esc` only closes popups.
- The new-token form shows validation errors inline under the name field.
- Empty views explain what to do next.
- The logo has transparent light and dark variants.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- HTTP API to send prompts to Claude Code and Codex, with polling and long-polling.
- A separate worker queue per agent, persisted in SQLite, with crash recovery.
- Bearer tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes, with roles, agent scopes, expiry and revocation.
- Stateful sessions that resume each token's Claude or Codex conversation.
- Optional public HTTPS through a Cloudflare quick tunnel.
- A live terminal dashboard covering overview, requests, tokens and logs.
- `hashi doctor`, `hashi token` and `hashi ask` commands.
